## The Problem (You’ve felt this)

- Classes move too fast or too slow, and content feels outdated.
- YouTube has great tutorials—but finding the right ones wastes hours.
- Studying alone is demotivating; most communities are noisy or inactive.
- Resumes and interviews are stressful, and feedback is vague.

We built Edify AI to remove the friction between you and real progress.
